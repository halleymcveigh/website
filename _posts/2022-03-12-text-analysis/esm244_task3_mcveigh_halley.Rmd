```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Read in the data from pdf
braiding_sweetgrass <- pdf_text(here("files", "braiding_sweetgrass.pdf"))

# Wrangle the text
braiding_lines <- data.frame(braiding_sweetgrass) %>% 
  mutate(page = 1:n()) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_split(braiding_sweetgrass, pattern = '\\n')) %>% 
  unnest(text_full) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_trim(text_full))

braiding_tidy <- braiding_lines %>%
  slice(-(1:194)) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text_full, token = "words") %>% 
  select(page, word)

# Remove stop words
braiding_words_clean <- braiding_tidy %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = 'word')

# Count words
word_counts <- braiding_words_clean %>% 
  count(word)
  
# Find the top 100 words 
top100_words <- word_counts %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(1:100)

palette <- wes_palette("Cavalcanti1", 4, type = "continuous")

# Make a wordcloud

#### A sentiment analysis with the NRC lexicon 
The NRC Emotino Lexicon is a compiled list of English words and their associated emotion, from eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) or sentiment (positive and negative). 
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
braiding_nrc <- braiding_words_clean %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

braiding_nrc_counts <- braiding_nrc %>% 
  count(page, sentiment)

palette10 = wes_palette("Cavalcanti1", 10, type = "continuous")

ggplot(data = braiding_nrc_counts, aes(x = page, y = n)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = sentiment), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(palette10)) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Word count", x = "Page number", title = "Sentiment analysis of Braiding Sweetgrass using the NRC lexicon")


```

**Figure 2.** Plots faceted by sentiments of *Braiding Sweetgrass* using the NRC lexicon by word count and page number. Stop words (as, the, if, and etc.) were removed. 



```{r, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(data = braiding_nrc_counts, aes(y = sentiment, x = n)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = sentiment),show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(palette10)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Word count", y = "Sentiment", title = "Sentiment analysis of Braiding Sweetgrass using the NRC lexicon")
```
