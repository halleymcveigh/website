      "contents": "\r\nI graduated from Warren Wilson College in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. I’ve has always gravitated towards the coast for both my career and many varied pastimes and am driven by the potential that healthy marine systems hold to sustain communities with food, energy, employment, and invaluable ecosystem services. During my undergraduate education, I carried out research in Maine for my thesis on the effect of climate change conditions on larval lobster development.\r\nConducting research with microscopy: a very colorful larval lobster!After graduation I began work in the environmental nonprofit sector in North Carolina before transitioning into research and industry environments. I entered the aquaculture field at Virginia Institute for Marine Sciences where I focused on breeding and genetics research of oysters.\r\nMonitoring a genetic line of oysters at one of our grow-out sitesI then returned to Maine to continue research and fieldwork with commercial shellfish hatcheries and farms.\r\nLot’s more time doing microscopy, this time with larval oystersAnd some good days out on the water at the farmBefore heading back to school to begin the MESM program at Bren I participated in the Sockeye salmon commercial season in Bristol Bay, AK.\r\nWe caught a lot of salmon and marveled in the beauty of Alaska\r\nMy experiences focus on improving marine aquaculture methods to increase productivity and resilience of sustainable seafood production in a changing climate. I’m interested in developing collaborative solutions that are both restorative for the ecosystem and economically beneficial for coastal communities. I’m passionate about protecting marine environments and resources while developing innovative ventures and resilience-based management.\r\nLink to my CV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
